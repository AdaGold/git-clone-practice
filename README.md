# Git Clone Practice

This is a small project that we'll use to demonstrate the process of cloning a repository.

## Requirements

- You should have one ruby file, `hello.rb`
- When run, this file should output the text `Hello World!` to the console


I am making a few comments here for practicing how to make a pull request.
